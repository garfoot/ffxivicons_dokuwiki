# ffxivicons_dokuwiki
Dokuwiki plugin for showing FFXIV skill icons in wiki pages

## Installation
Zip this up and import it into your Dokuwiki to use.

## Use
Syntax for the plugin is simple. ```{{fficon>skill name}}``` and that's it. E.g. ```{{fficon>savage blade}}``` would display the icon for Savage Blade.

Currently only pre Heavensward icons are implemented. These come from the FFXIV fan kit and are all that are currently provided.
